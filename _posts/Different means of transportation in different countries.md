> 2. 95% of American households own a car,it is estimated that a slim 17% of Chinese households own a car.(Now it is 19%)Chinese riders inherently spend a much larger percentage of their income on public/local transportation. 
> 3. Subway systems are a staple in Chinese cities.Public buses are another means of daily escort for many Chinese. 
> 4. Last but not least, when it comes to taxis, China and the US are hardly comparable. Taxi    fares are far more expensive in US

> 1.  Europe decided to use its railroads to move people while the United States decided to use them for freight. Most European railroads were government-owned, while American railroads were private.
> 2. The biggest advantage of the American way is mobility. The average American travels twice as many miles/kilometers per year as the average European. Per capita shipments of freight in the U.S. are also nearly twice those of Europe. 



#  Means of different countries towards controlling pollution from cars

## Cars, Trucks, Buses and Air Pollution.[link](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/cars-trucks-buses-and-air-pollution)

> 1. Battery- and fuel cell–electric trucks and buses, especially transit buses, are already operating in cities across the United States.A growing number of cities are committed to 100 percent zero-emission transit buses in their fleets—including New York and Los Angeles, which represent the two largest bus fleets in the country.
> 2. The right policies and investments from federal, state, and municipal governments will accelerate the transition to a zero-emissions transportation system. 

## Transport pollution: Some practical solutions for developing countries.[link](https://blogs.worldbank.org/transport/transport-pollution-some-practical-solutions-developing-countries)

> 1. Driving Restrictions: In a bid to reduce congestion and air pollution, some cities have chosen to restrain commuters from using their cars during rush hour on a specific day of the week, which typically varies for each driver based on the last digits of their license plate number. (Beijing,Chengdu and other cities)
> 2. Import Regulations on Second-Hand Vehicles.(about emissions)
> 3. Electrification
> 4. Low Emission Zones (LEZs),This scheme has been adopted in many European cities and in three different areas of Hong Kong.
